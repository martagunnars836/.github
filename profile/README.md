Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate software developer with over 5 years of experience specializing in full stack development. My primary languages are JavaScript, Python, and Java, but I enjoy working with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.

I have worked extensively with frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Django. I also have experience in creating RESTful APIs and developing microservices. My interests include cloud computing and I have hands-on experience with AWS and Azure services.

In addition to technical expertise, I strongly believe in best practices and principles of software development, including Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and Agile methodologies. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

Here are a few of my pinned repositories that showcase my projects and contributions:

- [Project One](https://github.com/martagunnars836/project-one): A responsive web application built with React and Node.js.
- [Project Two](https://github.com/martagunnars836/project-two): A Python-based RESTful API for managing tasks.
- [Project Three](https://github.com/martagunnars836/project-three): A cloud-native application deployed on AWS, demonstrating microservices architecture.

I enjoy sharing knowledge and collaborating with other developers. Feel free to explore my repositories, check out my projects, and connect with me. Let's build something great together!
